# mySQL-Data-Cleaning

I have cleaned the raw data using MySQL Workbench, employing various cleaning methods such as:

- Removed duplicate data where necessary.
- Standardized the data.
- Addressed null or blank values.
- Removed rows that do not provide insights relevant to our data collection objectives.
- Eliminated columns that are not useful or were created solely for data cleaning purposes.
